### Welcome to my Page!

As a member of Dr. Adriana Dawes' lab at the Ohio State University I have been given the unique oportunity to grow as an independent researcher in the fields of Molecular Genetics and Mathematics. We are given full ownership of our research projects and were required to develope novel protocols and methods to answer previously unthought of questions. We are also able to collaborate with other working on research projects from both the mathematical side and the biology side. This gives me great insight and allows for creative solutions to problems that others may not even realize exist.

## I'm Currently Working on:
 
 - Finishing my PhD dissertation with a denfense date of early July!
 - Writing a manuscrript draft of my work targeting a publication in Nature!!
