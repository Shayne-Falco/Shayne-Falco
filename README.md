### Welcome to my Page!

As a member of Dr. Adriana Dawes' lab at the Ohio State University I have been given the unique oportunity to grow as an independent researcher in the fields of Molecular Genetics and Mathematics. We are given full ownership of our research projects and were required to develope novel protocols and methods to answer previously unthought of questions. We are also able to collaborate with other working on research projects from both the mathematical side and the biology side. This gives me great insight and allows for creative solutions to problems that others may not even realize exist.

## I'm Currently Working on:
 
 - Finishing my PhD dissertation with a denfense date of early November!
 - Writing a manuscrript draft of my work targeting a publication in Nature!!
 - Developing portfolio projects and website to showcase some of the things I have learned that I currently don't have a project for:
   - Bioinformatics
   - Singnaling Network Models
   - Data Viualization using XMGRACE, Inkscape, and visual dashboards
 
## I'm Currently Learning:

 - Time Managment and how to motiviate myself to write a PhD dissertation in time.
 - Python packages for data analysis and visualization.

## Ask Me About:

 - How to deal with setback and troubles in graduate school.
 - How I transitioned from a mathematician to a biologist and how I am currently applying both of those backgrounds.
 
 ## Fun Fact
 - I'm two meters (6 foot 7 inches) tall.
