# Shayne M. Plourde
### Welcome to my Page!

I am a postdoctoral scientist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. I work within the Institute of Genomic Medicine (IGM) 's variant detection team to try and find the genetic cause of diseases. I am excited by the chance to see my work pay off more directly than ever before.

Previously, as a Ph.D. graduate of Dr. Adriana Dawes' lab at the Ohio State University, I grew as an independent Molecular Genetics and Mathematics researcher. We were given full ownership of our research projects and were required to develop novel protocols and methods to answer previously unthought-of questions. We can also collaborate with others working on research projects from both the mathematical and biology sides. This gives me great insight and allows for creative solutions to problems others may not even realize exist.

## I'm Currently Working on:
 
 - Writing a manuscript draft of my work targeting a publication in Nature!!
 - Developing portfolio projects and a website to showcase some of the things I have learned that I currently don't have a project for:
   - Bioinformatics
   - Computational Genomics
   - Large Signaling Network Models
   - Software Development
   - Data Visualization using XMGRACE, Inkscape, and visual dashboards
 
## I'm Currently Learning:

 - Python packages for data analysis and visualization.

## Ask Me About:

 - How do you deal with setbacks and troubles in graduate school?
 - Advice on transitioning out of academia and into industry. I have lots of resources that have helped me decide to leave.
 - How I transitioned from a mathematician to a biologist and how I am currently applying both of those backgrounds in Genetics.
 - My dissertation or publications.
 
 ## Fun Fact
 - I'm two meters (6 foot 7 inches) tall.
